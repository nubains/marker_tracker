# marker_tracker

Overview
---

This is my first project for the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nano-Degree. It entails writing code to identify the lane line markings on the road given a video stream from the front facing camera on a car. This was accomplished using Python and OpenCV and made use of concepts including region masking, Gaussian blur, Canny edge detection, and the Hough Transform.
